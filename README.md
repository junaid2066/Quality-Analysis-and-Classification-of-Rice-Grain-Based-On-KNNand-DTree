# Quality-Analysis-and-Classification-of-Rice-Grain-Based-On-KNNand-DTree
Outlines the development of system for classification and quality analysis of different kind of rice grains.  Six different type of rice including Jasmine, Basmati, Saila, Arborio and Super colonel. Data set was compiled by taking 2000 images of each type of rice. Impurities involved in rice grain was eliminated by data cleaning process. Correlation of different attributes was find by using HUE Map and BOX PLOT. After pre-processing the complete data, K-NN and decision tree algorithms will be used for classification and quality analysis of different kind of rice grains. Accuracy of both techniques will be determined and compared.
